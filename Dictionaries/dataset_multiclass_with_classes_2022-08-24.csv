"The WHO R&D Blueprint score has never been used to assess the benefit of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Tocilizumab is an extensively used immune active agent which showed discordant results in the reduction of IMV and mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [7] [8] [9]. On the contrary, initial randomized clinical trials, did not show any benefit [7, 11] , while recent large randomized trials suggest reduced likelihood of progression to IMV and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab [12] [13] [14]. A multivariable multi-state model was then considered, where the associations between the administration of tocilizumab and the changes of states were adjusted for the following variables: age, gender, SOFA score at hospital admission, time from the onset of COVID-19 in Modena and administrations of glucocorticoids and lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/cobicistat. There was no evidence of modification of the effect of tocilizumab, due to age, gender, SOFA score, time from Covid-19 onset and other pharmacological interventions, based on significance testing of interaction terms. This prospective observational study showed the beneficial effect of tocilizumab in reducing the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 observational studies including 1358 patients demonstrated that mortality was 12% lower for COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab compared to patients who were not treated with tocilizumab. The number needed to treat was 11, suggesting that for every 11 COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab 1 death was prevented. Given the design of the study, we could not assess the role of tocilizumab without standard of care, therefore, we argue that tocilizumab alone may not be sufficient as a treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia",1,Positive

"Dexamethasone, already approved by the FDA for various indications, has been shown to reduce COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients requiring oxygen alone or mechanical ventilation (9, 10). We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a large, multicenter, longitudinal cohort of persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the United States, to comprehensively characterize the use of hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and dexamethasone to treat COVID-19. The results from the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial on dexamethasone were released in mid-June and showed clinical benefit among patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen (9). Because glucocorticoids other than dexamethasone may have been used (26), we included any oral glucocorticoid use among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from July 2020 to February 2021. These findings are important because of continued high levels of morbidity and mortality in the United States due to COVID-19, as well as a robust evidence base supporting the value of dexamethasone in reducing the likelihood of death among persons with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation (10, 11). We also found that despite treatment guidelines from the National Institutes of Health regarding the use of dexamethasone for COVID-19, approximately one fifth of mechanically ventilated patients during the most recent months of observation in our cohort did not receive a glucocorticoid, a finding that persisted after those who may not have been eligible because of early discharge or death were excluded.

"Gemcitabine treatment in cancer cell lines with Hippo pathway genetic alterations significantly reduced 3D spheroid growth, including lung cancer cells with STK11 mutations (A549, NCIH23) [57]. However, due to the role of YAP activation by Hippo-dependent or Hippo-independent mechanisms in different types of lung cancer, it is tempting to posit that gemcitabine could be a good reagent for co-treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumours with YAP overexpression, pretreatment or post-treatment. Exposure of triple-negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy (carboplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine or paclitaxel) induces the expression of HIF-1ÃŽÂ± and HIF-2ÃŽÂ±, leading to the expression of PD-L1, CD73 and CD47, which promotes suppression of innate antitumour immunity mediated by macrophages, dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, as well as suppression of adaptive immunity mediated by T cells [62].

Further dose-response analysis confirmed that metformin is safe for psoriasis patients with diabetes [26]. However, there was only one RCT available for metformin as a potential option in the treatment of psoriasis patients with metabolic syndrome [11, 27].

"(3) If successful, the ongoing clinical study on raloxifene, a wellknown SERM, in paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients could represent a valid opportunity of treatment for controlling disease progression. Among the molecules identified with potential antiviral activity, raloxifene was selected as a promising molecule to treat mild-to-moderate symptoms, and paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients due to the predicted ability to bind (Fig. Raloxifene exerts its pharmacological activity at very low circulating levels (nM) but with wide distribution into body tissues, thus reaching appropriate levels mainly in lungs, kidneys, and liver [86] , and supporting a direct effect in target tissues in COVID-19 patients. The good distribution profile of raloxifene in the lungs, highly susceptible to viral infections, is particularly relevant since the low concentrations reached in pulmonary tissue is considered one of the major limitations of other antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, currently used to treat COVID-19 respiratory complications. Raloxifene has been selected as a clinical candidate for clinical studies in paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients based on a scientific rationale and literature evidence supporting both a potential antiviral action and protective action of SERMs through ERdependent and independent mechanisms, as well as a protective role of the ER-signaling pathway, probably relevant in the observed gender sensitivity to COVID-19 and SARS-Cov-2, as well as to other coronaviruses. Raloxifene showed an optimal activity profile to advance it further as a drug with a potential COVID-19 indication. The rationale to speed up the development of raloxifene is further supported by its safety profile derived from long-term treatment data, also in special populations; the potential risks of severe side effects, intrinsic to the class of SERMs, are considered negligible for short-term treatments as those planned for future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.

A Phase III trial, NCT01101438, ""Metformin Versus Placebo on Recurrence and Survival in Early Stage Breast Cancer"" is due to be completed in early 2022. A logical target whereby metformin could mediate its putative antiproliferative effects in cancer is via inhibition of mTOR and the serine-threonine kinase, ribosomal S6K (pS6K), either via activation of AMPK or via an AMPK-independent pathway (241, 242). It has also been argued that the inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 is an important contributor to the cytotoxic effects of metformin and has been observed in cancer cells and supported by data showing reduced inhibition of tumor growth in cancer cells expressing a metformin-resistant yeast complex 1, NDI1 (136, 243). argue that higher concentrations of metformin are necessary in in vitro cell culture protocols because the abundance of growth factors and nutrients, such as glucose, reduces the sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of metformin thus reflecting the importance of glucose and the Warburg effect for cancer cell growth as well as the importance of glycemic control in diabetes (249). Studies of the effects of glucose concentration on the anti-proliferative effects of metformin on breast cancer cell growth in different human cancer lines In vitro studies reveal that triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) are particularly sensitive to the pro-proliferative effects of glucose, and TNBC cells are more sensitive to metformin at lower levels of glucose (250). have also demonstrated using a cell culture protocol that higher levels of glucose reduce the ability of metformin to inhibit cancer cell proliferation (247). An argument to explain the selective action of metformin in some cancers but not all is that there is a differential expression of the influx and efflux transporters in tumor cells that allows for the intracellular accumulation of metformin in the cancer cell and resultant selective toxicity (158). who compared metformin uptake levels and inhibiting activity on cancer cell growth in a human breast cancer cell line (BT-20) deficient in OCTs and a BT-20 cell line overexpressing organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), OCT3-BH20 cells: OCT3 is also a predominant transporter in human breast neoplasms (241). In contrast and although LnCaP, a prostate cancer line, proved to be particularly sensitive to metformin and in a concentration range that was within that expected clinically and correlated with a high expression of mRNA for OCT3 and low expression of MATE2 for the other cell lines, very high concentrations, up to 10mM, of metformin were required to see significant inhibition, and a strong significant correlation between inhibition of proliferation and MATE2 expression was not seen (254). By lowering plasma glucose levels and body weight, metformin improves the metabolic profile of the patient and thereby reduces the severity and risk of other diseases associated with diabetes such as cardiovascular, cancer, and also neurodegenerative diseases (267)",1,Positive
"Secondly, a recent review of Single Low Dose (SLD) primaquine studies concluded that a single low dose of primaquine added to an artemisinin regimen for malaria reduces infectiousness to mosquitoes though it was unclear whether this reduction would materially reduce malaria transmission in communities [18].

"Conclusion: Anlotinib is likely to be a cost-effective option compared with placebo for patients with relapsed SCLC who experience failure of at least two lines of chemotherapy in In China, lung cancer is the most common carcinoma, and the proportion of SCLC shows an increasing tendency, which leads to considerable economic burden Anlotinib is the only approved third-line therapy for SCLC in China; however, the exorbitant price of the novel therapy is always a key consideration for cancer treatment This study aimed to investigate whether anlotinib was cost-effective in the thirdor further-line setting for patients with relapsed SCLC in China The results showed that the ICER of anlotinib versus placebo was $17,741. 94 per QALY, which did not exceed the WTP threshold of $30,833 per QALY, so anlotinib is a cost-effective option as third-or further-line treatment for SCLC in China Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost of anlotinib and utility of PFS state in the anlotinib group were the most influential factors in the model, and the probability According to the latest global cancer statistics from 2020, lung cancer is ranked the second most common malignancy and is still the leading cause of cancer death [1, 2]",1,Positive

"Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 2014 1 and the Drug Controller General of India in October 2017 for the management of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast has immunomodulatory activity which partially blocks the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and induces the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines that have a pathogenic role in psoriasis. Although the efficacy and safety of apremilast have been extensively documented in clinical trials, as well as in real-world studies on the management of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] little is known about its real-world use, such as the correct positioning as monotherapy and combination therapy, titration practices, and variations in dosage. 8 To augment the existing evidence on the use of apremilast, a group of experts with over 15 years' experience in psoriasis came together to evaluate clinical and realworld scenarios and aspects of treatment for which the information in the literature was considered to be lacking. To assess the real-world experience of apremilast use in psoriasis, an expert panel was formed composed of five dermatologists with a minimum of 15 years' experience in the management of psoriasis and experience of apremilast prescription for at least 2 years. A total of 75 practicing dermatologists from India with a minimum of 10 years' experience in the management of psoriasis and 2 years of apremilast use were selected. A total of 28 questions were asked regarding different domains such as positioning of apremilast in psoriasis, its use in difficult-to-treat areas, special conditions and populations, safety, dose titration, and dose in maintenance therapy. In the landmark clinical trials on apremilast in plaque psoriasis, monotherapy was found to be safe and efficacious for the long term. Even real-world studies in India 9-11 supported the long-term use of apremilast monotherapy as an efficacious and safe treatment option for the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Besides monotherapy, apremilast in combination therapy could be used to reduce disease activity in recalcitrant plaque psoriasis. 12 Drug survival of apremilast in patients who were also on other systemic agents (84% survived the drug and 16% Our survey also revealed that a majority of the dermatologists preferred to use apremilast as a part of combination therapy in moderate to severe psoriasis. However, according to experts, apremilast monotherapy could also be used with good efficacy in patients with stable mild to moderate psoriasis with a body surface area (BSA) involvement <10%. This is supported by Del Alcazar et al, who concluded that apremilast may be an alternative for treating moderate psoriasis, with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of around 10. 17 The panel suggested that the combination of cyclosporine and apremilast could be a viable option in severe psoriasis by virtue of rapid relief with cyclosporine, followed by apremilast continued for a longer duration to maintain remission. The panel remarked that apremilast could be added as a maintenance or switchover drug in patients receiving methotrexate or cyclosporine with acceptable control of psoriasis. Currently, apremilast is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, but it has shown effectiveness in difficult-to-treat forms of psoriasis, such as scalp, face, palmoplantar, and nail psoriasis, and hence can be considered in these cases. 15, 23 The ESTEEM 1 AND ESTEEM 2 phase III doubleblinded efficacy and safety trials evaluated the efficacy of apremilast in nail and scalp psoriasis. 24 Various other studies have also shown the efficacy of apremilast for the treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis 25 and nail psoriasis. 26 The clinicians in our survey reported the use of apremilast for palmoplantar, scalp, and nail psoriasis, other than plaque psoriasis, as a second-line drug. 7% of the clinicians in our survey reported that up to 50% of their psoriasis patients have complete clearance of disease within 16 weeks of apremilast therapy. Paller et al, in a phase II study, 32 reported that apremilast 20 mg twice daily in 21 children in the age group 6-11 years with psoriasis had a similar pharmacokinetic profile to that of adults on apremilast 30 mg twice daily. 33, 34 Based on the available evidence and results of the survey, the experts opined that apremilast can be considered in pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis who are not responding to topical therapy. 42 The experts opined that apremilast may be of particular interest in patients with psoriasis along with obesity and metabolic syndrome, who may benefit from the side effect of weight loss. 60 In addition, apremilast, not being contraindicated in serious infections and providing other benefits, represents a promising therapeutic option in the management of psoriasis in HIV patients. A pooled analysis of landmark clinical trials in psoriasis did not report reactivation of TB with apremilast. 41 In the post-marketing report of 117,728 psoriasis patients who were exposed to apremilast, only three patients reported TB and none of the patients discontinued therapy with apremilast. 41 However, in a consensus study on the use of apremilast in psoriasis, published in 2020, 8 and a realworld study by Mayba and Gooderham, 7 it was recommended that laboratory monitoring should be carried out only in selected cases. 79 In addition, in a Spanish consensus study on the use of apremilast in psoriasis, it was recommended that a prolonged induction phase will serve as an effective strategy to mitigate gastrointestinal AEs. In various studies, apremilast has been evaluated as monotherapy or in combination therapy for long-term maintenance in patients with plaque psoriasis. 4, 6, 7 After considering these facts, the experts commented that apremilast should be preferred as long-term maintenance therapy in patients with plaque psoriasis because of its better safety profile, lack of organ toxicity, and reduced need for laboratory monitoring. Even though the approved dose of apremilast is 30 mg twice daily, a few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of apremilast 20 mg twice daily in patients with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. [81] [82] [83] Ohtsuki et al reported similar results in patients with plaque psoriasis with apremilast 20 mg twice daily. The clinicians who participated in this study view apremilast as an attractive option for the individualized treatment of psoriasis. In the end, considering the chronicity of the disease and the comparative efficacy, safety, and use of this drug in comorbid conditions, apremilast has become one of the favorable options in the armamentarium of psoriasis management",1,Positive

"   indeed, preclinical studies from our laboratory [9] [10] [11] [12] and other investigators [13, 14] ) have previously shown that long term estrogen deprivation of er-positive mcf-7 breast cancer cells causes them to lose their dependency on estradiol for proliferation, which recapitulates acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women, and that these ai-resistant breast cancer cells paradoxically undergo apoptosis in the presence of estradiol [10] [11] [12] 15, 16]  ..    the ability of estradiol to induce apoptosis in ai-resistant breast cancer cells was previously shown to be mediated, in part, by the mitochondria death pathway [11] ; however, more recent findings suggest that dysregulation of the interferon signaling pathway might also play a role in estradiol-induced cell death [17]  .",2,Neutral

"In this review, our goal is to elucidate the anti-aging proprieties of curcumin in the brain by acting on different target proteins, inducing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory events, modulating microglia neuroprotection, and finally acting on telomerases to arrest cancer progression. In this review, our goal is to elucidate the anti-aging proprieties of curcumin in the brain by acting on different target proteins, inducing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory events, modulating microglia neuroprotection, and finally acting on telomerases to arrest cancer progression. In various types of cancers, curcumin was shown to selectively target cells that express telomerase enzyme making these cells more vulnerable to curcumin-induced cytotoxicity of cancer cells. The long-term studies on brain tumor cells highlighted the use of curcumin as an adjuvant for cancer therapy. Treatment with curcumin induces a significant telomere shortening in brain tumor cells suggesting its potential clinical application as telomerase inhibitor and use of curcumin in adjuvant cancer therapy [105]. Long-term studies on brain tumor cells underscore the use of curcumin in adjuvant cancer therapy. It has been shown that curcumin micelles are an excellent intravenously injectable aqueous formulation of curcumin; this formulation can inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma through inhibiting angiogenesis and directly killing cancer cells [114].

"Current guidelines or recommendations from multiple institutes and organizations do not adequately acknowledge the potential acute consequences in patients receiving both rituximab and COVID-19 vaccination, and the appropriate timing between rituximab infusion and vaccination has not been established. In this brief report, we report a case of rituximab-induced lympholysis and pancytopenia in a patient who received the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 10 days before rituximab infusion. No acute events associated with rituximab infusion and recent vaccination, particularly the COVID-19 vaccine, have been described. Here, we report a case of rituximab-induced lympholysis and pancytopenia in a patient who received the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 10 days prior to rituximab infusion, highlighting the need for increased caution when considering anti-CD20 therapy with COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients and the urgent need to update current guidelines. This response upon rituximab re-initiation was very likely related to receiving the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 10 days before. Given that the patient recently received his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 10 days before the rituximab infusion, and the secondary immune response after the booster immunization usually peaks between 7 and 30 days, 10 Figure 1 ), almost 4 months before the vaccination. 13 It has been recognized that rituximab can impact the efficacy of various vaccines, and some organizations have proposed general recommendations on the timing of rituximab treatment relative to the COVID-19 vaccination. However, the potential acute consequences when patients receive both rituximab and the COVID-19 vaccine have not been sufficiently appreciated and the current guidelines on COVID-19 vaccination for patients receiving anti-CD20 therapies need to be updated urgently. If systemic anti-CD20 therapy is necessary for newly diagnosed or relapsed malignancies or maintenance therapy and the benefits of COVID-19 prevention does not outweigh the benefits of anti-CD20 therapy, COVID-19 vaccination should be postponed until 3 months (4 halflives of rituximab in vivo) after the completion of anti-CD20 therapy or the B-cell counts have recovered to over 0",2,Neutral
