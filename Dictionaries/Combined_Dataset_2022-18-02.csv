cancer,estradiol,"   indeed, preclinical studies from our laboratory [9] [10] [11] [12] and other investigators [13, 14] ) have previously shown that long term estrogen deprivation of er-positive mcf-7 breast cancer cells causes them to lose their dependency on estradiol for proliferation, which recapitulates acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women, and that these ai-resistant breast cancer cells paradoxically undergo apoptosis in the presence of estradiol [10] [11] [12] 15, 16]  ..    the ability of estradiol to induce apoptosis in ai-resistant breast cancer cells was previously shown to be mediated, in part, by the mitochondria death pathway [11] ; however, more recent findings suggest that dysregulation of the interferon signaling pathway might also play a role in estradiol-induced cell death [17]  .",0.0,9,-0.0006944444444444,inde preclin studi laboratori investig previous_shown long_term estrogen depriv er_posit mcf_breast cancer cell caus lose depend estradiol prolifer recapitul acquir resist aromatas_inhibitor postmenopaus_women ai resist breast_cancer cell paradox undergo apoptosi presenc estradiol abil estradiol induc_apoptosi ai resist breast_cancer cell previous_shown mediat part mitochondria death pathway howev recent find_suggest dysregul interferon signal_pathway might_also play_role estradiol induc cell death

covid-19,chloroquine,".   this has led in china to include chloroquine in the recommendations regarding the prevention and treatment of covid-19 pneumonia [4, 6]  .   the results of these trials will be the first available on humans, since studies published to date on the characteristics and management of patients with covid-19 did not report data about chloroquine use [1, [12] [13] [14] [15]  .   they showed that chloroquine could reduce the length of hospital stay and improve the evolution of covid-19 pneumonia [4, 6] , leading to recommend the administration of 500 mg of chloroquine twice a day in patients with mild, moderate and severe forms of covid-19 pneumonia .   the vital ethical issue is whether administration of chloroquine in the setting of covid-19 is experimental, and therefore requires ethical trial approval, or off-label (i .   the worldwide ongoing trials, including those involving the care of patients in our institute [90] , will verify whether the hopes raised by chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 can be confirmed .   at the time of preparation of this manuscript, the chinese academy of medical sciences and the china-japan friendship hospital had launched a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled clinical trial in wuhan to test the effectiveness of remdesivir as an antiviral drug against 2019-ncov, [12, 13] and studies have already shown that chloroquine phosphate is an effective treatment for covid-19 .   timely adjustment management and treatment strategy prior to guideline update: the first evidence of digestive tract involvement in covid-19 has been found, and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 has been carried out in our hospital .   although the use of chloroquine may be supported by expert opinion, clinical use of this drug in patients with covid-19 should adhere to the meuri framework or after ethical approval as a trial as stated by the who .   and the earliest clinical trial of chloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 had been carried out in our hospital, which was helpful for including of chloroquine in updated guideline .   clinical trials on promising regimens for covid-19, such as remdesivir, lopinavir, and chloroquine phosphate are ongoing, which shed light on conquering the covid-19 epidemic 12  .   a recent paper reported that both chloroquine and the antiviral drug remdesivir inhibited sars-cov-2 in vitro and suggested these drugs be assessed in human patients suffering from covid-19 [49]  .   at least 16 different trials for sars-cov-2 already registered in the chinese clinical trial registry (chictr2000029939, chictr2000029935, chictr2000029899, chictr2000029898, chictr2000029868, chictr2000029837, chictr2000029826,

hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of covid-19 (""chinese clinical trial register"" (chictr)) .   there is sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence regarding the effectiveness of chloroquine for treatment of covid-19 as well as evidence of safety from long-time use in clinical practice for other indications [3] to justify clinical research on the topic .   besides, chloroquine phosphate was reported to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against covid-19 in a multicenter clinical trials 21 and had just been included in the latest edition of the guidelines for china

COVID-19,Tocilizumab,"The WHO R&D Blueprint score has never been used to assess the benefit of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Tocilizumab is an extensively used immune active agent which showed discordant results in the reduction of IMV and mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [7] [8] [9]. On the contrary, initial randomized clinical trials, did not show any benefit [7, 11] , while recent large randomized trials suggest reduced likelihood of progression to IMV and death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab [12] [13] [14]. A multivariable multi-state model was then considered, where the associations between the administration of tocilizumab and the changes of states were adjusted for the following variables: age, gender, SOFA score at hospital admission, time from the onset of COVID-19 in Modena and administrations of glucocorticoids and lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/cobicistat. There was no evidence of modification of the effect of tocilizumab, due to age, gender, SOFA score, time from Covid-19 onset and other pharmacological interventions, based on significance testing of interaction terms. This prospective observational study showed the beneficial effect of tocilizumab in reducing the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 observational studies including 1358 patients demonstrated that mortality was 12% lower for COVID-19 patients treated with tocilizumab compared to patients who were not treated with tocilizumab.

COVID-19,Dexamethasone,"Dexamethasone, already approved by the FDA for various indications, has been shown to reduce COVID-19 mortality among hospitalized patients requiring oxygen alone or mechanical ventilation (9, 10). We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a large, multicenter, longitudinal cohort of persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the United States, to comprehensively characterize the use of hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and dexamethasone to treat COVID-19. The results from the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) trial on dexamethasone were released in mid-June and showed clinical benefit among patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen (9). Because glucocorticoids other than dexamethasone may have been used (26), we included any oral glucocorticoid use among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from July 2020 to February 2021. These findings are important because of continued high levels of morbidity and mortality in the United States due to COVID-19, as well as a robust evidence base supporting the value of dexamethasone in reducing the likelihood of death among persons with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation (10, 11). We also found that despite treatment guidelines from the National Institutes of Health regarding the use of dexamethasone for COVID-19, approximately one fifth of mechanically ventilated patients during the most recent months of observation in our cohort did not receive a glucocorticoid, a finding that persisted after those who may not have been eligible because of early discharge or death were excluded.

cancer,Gemcitabine,"Gemcitabine treatment in cancer cell lines with Hippo pathway genetic alterations significantly reduced 3D spheroid growth, including lung cancer cells with STK11 mutations (A549, NCIH23) [57]. However, due to the role of YAP activation by Hippo-dependent or Hippo-independent mechanisms in different types of lung cancer, it is tempting to posit that gemcitabine could be a good reagent for co-treatment in EGFR-mutant NSCLC tumours with YAP overexpression, pretreatment or post-treatment. Exposure of triple-negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy (carboplatin, doxorubicin, gemcitabine or paclitaxel) induces the expression of HIF-1Î± and HIF-2Î±, leading to the expression of PD-L1, CD73 and CD47, which promotes suppression of innate antitumour immunity mediated by macrophages, dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, as well as suppression of adaptive immunity mediated by T cells [62].

Clinical findings demonstrated that metformin can significantly improve psoriasis severity by modulating the immune response [14]. A 17-year population-based real-world cohort study focused on the safety of metformin in psoriatic patients with type 2diabetes and found that metformin did not lead to increased mortality, severe psoriasis, and hospitalizations related to psoriasis. Further dose-response analysis confirmed that metformin is safe for psoriasis patients with diabetes [26]. However, there was only one RCT available for metformin as a potential option in the treatment of psoriasis patients with metabolic syndrome [11, 27]. And the efficacy and safety of metformin in other psoriasis patients have not been determined. In conclusion, the current evidence demonstrates that pioglitazone but not rosiglitazone and metformin is effective in treating plaque psoriasis in diabetic patients",1.0,10,0.1447278911564626,similar antidiabet drug metformin use also found decreas risk psoriasi larg casecontrol cohort studi clinic find demonstr metformin significantli_improv psoriasi sever modul immun_respons a_year popul_base real_world cohort studi focus safeti metformin psoriat patient type found metformin not lead increas mortal sever psoriasi hospit relat psoriasi further dose respons analysi confirm metformin safe psoriasi patient diabet howev one rct avail metformin potenti option treatment psoriasi patient metabol syndrom and efficaci_safeti metformin psoriasi patient not determin in_conclus current evid demonstr pioglitazon not rosiglitazon metformin effect treat plaqu_psoriasi diabet patient
COVID-19,Rituximab,"Current guidelines or recommendations from multiple institutes and organizations do not adequately acknowledge the potential acute consequences in patients receiving both rituximab and COVID-19 vaccination, and the appropriate timing between rituximab infusion and vaccination has not been established. In this brief report, we report a case of rituximab-induced lympholysis and pancytopenia in a patient who received the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 10 days before rituximab infusion. No acute events associated with rituximab infusion and recent vaccination, particularly the COVID-19 vaccine, have been described. Here, we report a case of rituximab-induced lympholysis and pancytopenia in a patient who received the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 10 days prior to rituximab infusion, highlighting the need for increased caution when considering anti-CD20 therapy with COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients and the urgent need to update current guidelines. This response upon rituximab re-initiation was very likely related to receiving the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 10 days before. Given that the patient recently received his second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 10 days before the rituximab infusion, and the secondary immune response after the booster immunization usually peaks between 7 and 30 days, 10 Figure 1 ), almost 4 months before the vaccination. 13 It has been recognized that rituximab can impact the efficacy of various vaccines, and some organizations have proposed general recommendations on the timing of rituximab treatment relative to the COVID-19 vaccination. However, the potential acute consequences when patients receive both rituximab and the COVID-19 vaccine have not been sufficiently appreciated and the current guidelines on COVID-19 vaccination for patients receiving anti-CD20 therapies need to be updated urgently. If systemic anti-CD20 therapy is necessary for newly diagnosed or relapsed malignancies or maintenance therapy and the benefits of COVID-19 prevention does not outweigh the benefits of anti-CD20 therapy, COVID-19 vaccination should be postponed until 3 months (4 halflives of rituximab in vivo) after the completion of anti-CD20 therapy or the B-cell counts have recovered to over 0",0.0,2,0.0287177328843995,current guidelin recommend multipl institut organ not adequ acknowledg potenti acut consequ patient receiv rituximab covid vaccin appropri time rituximab infus vaccin not establish in_brief report report case rituximab induc lympholysi pancytopenia patient receiv second dose moderna covid vaccin day rituximab infus no acut event associ rituximab infus recent vaccin particularli covid vaccin describ here_report case rituximab induc lympholysi pancytopenia patient receiv second dose moderna covid vaccin day prior rituximab infus highlight need increas caution_consid anti therapi covid vaccin cancer patient urgent need updat current guidelin thi respons upon rituximab initi like relat receiv second dose moderna covid vaccin day given patient recent receiv second dose moderna covid vaccin day rituximab infus secondari immun_respons booster immun usual peak day figur almost month vaccin it recogn rituximab impact efficaci variou vaccin organ propos gener recommend time rituximab treatment rel covid vaccin howev potenti acut consequ patient receiv rituximab covid vaccin not suffici appreci current guidelin covid vaccin patient receiv anti therapi need updat urgent if system anti therapi necessari newli_diagnos relaps malign mainten therapi benefit covid prevent not outweigh benefit anti therapi covid vaccin postpon month halfliv rituximab vivo complet anti therapi b_cell count recov

In this review, our goal is to elucidate the anti-aging proprieties of curcumin in the brain by acting on different target proteins, inducing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory events, modulating microglia neuroprotection, and finally acting on telomerases to arrest cancer progression. In various types of cancers, curcumin was shown to selectively target cells that express telomerase enzyme making these cells more vulnerable to curcumin-induced cytotoxicity of cancer cells. The long-term studies on brain tumor cells highlighted the use of curcumin as an adjuvant for cancer therapy. Treatment with curcumin induces a significant telomere shortening in brain tumor cells suggesting its potential clinical application as telomerase inhibitor and use of curcumin in adjuvant cancer therapy [105]. Long-term studies on brain tumor cells underscore the use of curcumin in adjuvant cancer therapy. It has been shown that curcumin micelles are an excellent intravenously injectable aqueous formulation of curcumin; this formulation can inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma through inhibiting angiogenesis and directly killing cancer cells [114]. It has been shown that curcumin micelles are an excellent intravenously injectable aqueous formulation of curcumin; this formulation can inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma through inhibiting angiogenesis and directly killing cancer cells [114].

pneumonia,Zinc,"Apart from diarrhea and taste disorders, zinc supplementation may be a tool for use against pneumonia, a disease that affects people in the extremes of age. [85] [86] [87] Inadequate zinc stores are suggestive of an increased risk for pneumonia in the elderly. 88 As such, in elderly nursing home residents with low serum zinc levels, after a year receiving 50% of the recommended dietary allowance for zinc, a higher risk of pneumonia and a longer duration of pneumonia episodes were observed, as well as increased use and duration of antibiotics for managing pneumonia. Furthermore, pneumonia is a major cause of child morbidity and mortality, 90-92 and a meta-analysis that selected 6 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (n Â¼ 2216) showed that supplementing zinc at 70 mg-280 mg for 7-14 days reduced childhood mortality caused by severe pneumonia without changing antibiotic therapy. First, pneumonia reflects COVID-19 severity; second, a high zinc dosage has been used for children and, thus, it is conceivable to supplement zinc at least at an equivalent (but possibly higher) dosage so that it can be an adjuvant in combating COVID-19 pneumonia. In summary, therapeutic zinc supplementation is well studied and recommended for children with pneumonia and diarrhea, 19, 85 but not for adults. â€¢ There is a concrete scientific basis supporting the effectiveness of supplementing with zinc in the management of pneumonia and diarrhea, which are an associated critical illness and a common symptom, respectively, of COVID-19, but this recommendation is for children without COVID-19",-1.0,9,0.0346428571428571,apart diarrhea tast disord zinc supplement may tool use pneumonia diseas_affect peopl extrem age inadequ zinc store suggest increas_risk pneumonia elderli as elderli nurs home resid low serum zinc level year receiv recommend dietari allow zinc higher_risk pneumonia longer durat pneumonia episod observ well increas use durat antibiot manag pneumonia furthermor pneumonia major caus child morbid_mortal meta_analysi select doubl_blind placebo control trial n show supplement zinc mg mg day reduc childhood mortal caus sever pneumonia without chang antibiot therapi first pneumonia reflect covid sever second high zinc dosag use children thu conceiv supplement zinc least equival possibl higher dosag adjuv combat covid pneumonia in_summari therapeut zinc supplement well studi recommend children pneumonia diarrhea not adult there concret scientif basi support effect supplement zinc manag pneumonia diarrhea associ critic_ill common symptom respect covid recommend children without covid

COVID-19,Raloxifene,"(3) If successful, the ongoing clinical study on raloxifene, a wellknown SERM, in paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients could represent a valid opportunity of treatment for controlling disease progression. Among the molecules identified with potential antiviral activity, raloxifene was selected as a promising molecule to treat mild-to-moderate symptoms, and paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients due to the predicted ability to bind (Fig. Raloxifene exerts its pharmacological activity at very low circulating levels (nM) but with wide distribution into body tissues, thus reaching appropriate levels mainly in lungs, kidneys, and liver [86] , and supporting a direct effect in target tissues in COVID-19 patients. The good distribution profile of raloxifene in the lungs, highly susceptible to viral infections, is particularly relevant since the low concentrations reached in pulmonary tissue is considered one of the major limitations of other antiviral drugs, such as remdesivir, currently used to treat COVID-19 respiratory complications. Raloxifene has been selected as a clinical candidate for clinical studies in paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients based on a scientific rationale and literature evidence supporting both a potential antiviral action and protective action of SERMs through ERdependent and independent mechanisms, as well as a protective role of the ER-signaling pathway, probably relevant in the observed gender sensitivity to COVID-19 and SARS-Cov-2, as well as to other coronaviruses. Raloxifene showed an optimal activity profile to advance it further as a drug with a potential COVID-19 indication. The rationale to speed up the development of raloxifene is further supported by its safety profile derived from long-term treatment data, also in special populations; the potential risks of severe side effects, intrinsic to the class of SERMs, are considered negligible for short-term treatments as those planned for future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients. Summarizing the above data suggests that ER modulation may be a suitable pharmacological approach for preventing/attenuating the cytokine storm and inflammation associated with COVID-19, and in particular the use of SERMs, specifically raloxifene, may represent a promising pharmacological option",1.0,6,0.1874361359126984,if success ongo clinic studi raloxifen wellknown serm paucisymptomat covid patient could_repres valid opportun treatment control diseas progress among molecul identifi potenti antivir activ raloxifen select promis molecul treat mild_moder symptom paucisymptomat covid patient due predict abil bind fig raloxifen exert pharmacolog activ low circul level nm wide distribut bodi tissu thu reach appropri level mainli lung kidney_liver support direct effect target tissu covid patient the good distribut profil raloxifen lung highli suscept viral_infect particularli relev sinc low concentr reach pulmonari tissu consid one major limit antivir drug remdesivir current use_treat covid respiratori complic raloxifen select clinic candid clinic studi paucisymptomat covid patient base scientif rational literatur evid support potenti antivir action protect action serm erdepend independ mechan well protect_role er signal_pathway probabl relev observ gender sensit covid sar_cov well coronavirus raloxifen show optim activ profil advanc drug potenti covid indic the rational speed develop raloxifen support safeti_profil deriv long_term treatment data also special popul potenti risk sever side_effect intrins class serm consid neglig short_term treatment plan futur_clinic trial covid patient summar data_suggest er modul may suitabl pharmacolog approach preventing/attenu cytokin_storm inflamm associ covid particular use serm specif raloxifen may repres promis pharmacolog option

COVID-19,Hydroxychloroquine,", hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir, ritonavir) have been or are being investigated for repurposing for COVID-19 [16] [17] [18] [19]. The proposed use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent and treat COVID-19 is based on its antiviral and immunomodulatory effects reported in the literature. In fact, early treatment of COVID-19 patients with orally administered hydroxychloroquine within one day of hospitalisation (400 mg twice a day on Day 1, followed by 200 mg twice a day on Days 2 to 5) decreased their risk of being transferred to intensive care units by 53%, which is attributed to the anti-inflammatory properties of the drug [36]. Despite the points discussed above suggesting the potential usefulness of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19, in vivo evidence supporting its clinical application is still lacking. Indeed, oral hydroxychloroquine has been reported to cause cardiac toxicity including QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias in both COVID-19 patients and patients with other illnesses (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, malaria) [21, 24, 30]. Robust, controlled clinical trials for hydroxychloroquine utilising a more efficient route of administration are required to better evaluate its efficacy in COVID-19. gov (accessed on 20 May 2021) database records several clinical studies on inhaled hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 at various stages of progress, from recently completed to not yet recruiting [58]",1.0,13,0.0494047619047619,hydroxychloroquin_azithromycin lopinavir_ritonavir investig repurpos covid the propos use hydroxychloroquin prevent treat covid base antivir immunomodulatori effect report literatur in_fact earli treatment covid patient oral administ hydroxychloroquin within one day hospitalis mg_twice day day follow mg_twice day day decreas risk transfer intens care_unit attribut anti inflammatori properti drug despit point discuss suggest potenti use hydroxychloroquin covid vivo evid support clinic applic still lack inde oral hydroxychloroquin report caus cardiac toxic includ qt_prolong ventricular arrhythmia covid patient patient ill rheumatoid_arthriti lupu_erythematosu malaria robust control clinic_trial hydroxychloroquin utilis effici rout_administr requir better evalu_efficaci covid gov access may databas record sever clinic studi inhal hydroxychloroquin covid variou stage progress recent complet not_yet recruit

cancer,Metformin,"However, via its ability to reduce early mortality associated with various diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline and cancer, metformin can improve healthspan thereby extending the period of life spent in good health. Interest in the potential clinical benefits of metformin has been extended to include repurposing for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), preeclampsia, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, and antibiotic and antiviral actions (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48). concluded that independent of its therapeutic efficacy as an antidiabetic drug, the use of metformin results in a reduction of allcause mortality associated with diseases that accelerate aging, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (37). 2 | Summaries of studies that focus on cellular actions of metformin to activate AMPK, reduce generation of reactive oxygen species, improve vascular function, mediate anti-inflammatory effects and the potential to treat cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. (113) â€¢ Case-control study tested hypothesis that patients using metformin have a reduced risk of cancer. â€¢ Conclusion: Epidemiological evidence that metformin reduces incidence of cancer. (114) â€¢ The effects of mM concentrations (5 to 20) of metformin were given to Panc 1 human pancreatic cancer cells in culture. â€¢ Conclusion: Vascular effects mediate beneficial effects of metformin on breast cancer. A retrospective study published in 2005 reported that patients with diabetes who had been treated with metformin for T2DM had a lower risk of cancer and highlighted the possible link between metformin and the serine-threonine tumor suppressor, LKB1, as a mechanism for the reduced risk (113) (see Table 2 ). Extensive support for a protective effect of metformin against cancer has been provided by numerous, but not all studies (237, 238). For instance, no association has been shown between the use of metformin and a lower incidence of bladder cancer and concerns have also been expressed how data from observational studies are analyzed (239, 240). gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/intervention/ metformin-hydrochloride) lists a number of on-going clinical trials involving metformin for the following: Her2 positive breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, endometrial and ovarian cancers, multiple myeloma, lymphocytic leukemia, and thyroid cancer. Examples include a Phase II study, NCT02028221, designed to determine whether metformin reduces obesityassociated breast cancer risk and due to be completed in mid-2021. A Phase III trial, NCT01101438, ""Metformin Versus Placebo on Recurrence and Survival in Early Stage Breast Cancer"" is due to be completed in early 2022. A logical target whereby metformin could mediate its putative antiproliferative effects in cancer is via inhibition of mTOR and the serine-threonine kinase, ribosomal S6K (pS6K), either via activation of AMPK or via an AMPK-independent pathway (241, 242). It has also been argued that the inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 is an important contributor to the cytotoxic effects of metformin and has been observed in cancer cells and supported by data showing reduced inhibition of tumor growth in cancer cells expressing a metformin-resistant yeast complex 1, NDI1 (136, 243). argue that higher concentrations of metformin are necessary in in vitro cell culture protocols because the abundance of growth factors and nutrients, such as glucose, reduces the sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of metformin thus reflecting the importance of glucose and the Warburg effect for cancer cell growth as well as the importance of glycemic control in diabetes (249). Studies of the effects of glucose concentration on the anti-proliferative effects of metformin on breast cancer cell growth in different human cancer lines In vitro studies reveal that triple negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) are particularly sensitive to the pro-proliferative effects of glucose, and TNBC cells are more sensitive to metformin at lower levels of glucose (250). have also demonstrated using a cell culture protocol that higher levels of glucose reduce the ability of metformin to inhibit cancer cell proliferation (247). An argument to explain the selective action of metformin in some cancers but not all is that there is a differential expression of the influx and efflux transporters in tumor cells that allows for the intracellular accumulation of metformin in the cancer cell and resultant selective toxicity (158). who compared metformin uptake levels and inhibiting activity on cancer cell growth in a human breast cancer cell line (BT-20) deficient in OCTs and a BT-20 cell line overexpressing organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), OCT3-BH20 cells: OCT3 is also a predominant transporter in human breast neoplasms (241). In contrast and although LnCaP, a prostate cancer line, proved to be particularly sensitive to metformin and in a concentration range that was within that expected clinically and correlated with a high expression of mRNA for OCT3 and low expression of MATE2 for the other cell lines, very high concentrations, up to 10mM, of metformin were required to see significant inhibition, and a strong significant correlation between inhibition of proliferation and MATE2 expression was not seen (254). By lowering plasma glucose levels and body weight, metformin improves the metabolic profile of the patient and thereby reduces the severity and risk of other diseases associated with diabetes such as cardiovascular, cancer, and also neurodegenerative diseases (267)",1.0,1,0.0277567706045966,howev via abil reduc earli mortal associ variou diseas includ diabet cardiovascular_diseas cognit_declin cancer metformin improv healthspan therebi extend period life spent good health interest potenti clinic benefit metformin extend includ repurpos polycyst_ovari syndrom pco preeclampsia cancer rheumatoid_arthriti malaria antibiot antivir action conclud independ therapeut efficaci antidiabet drug use metformin result reduct allcaus mortal associ diseas acceler age includ cancer cardiovascular_diseas summari studi focu cellular action metformin activ ampk reduc gener reactiv_oxygen speci improv vascular function mediat anti inflammatori effect potenti treat cancer neurodegen diseas case_control studi test hypothesi patient use metformin reduc risk cancer conclus epidemiolog evid metformin reduc_incid cancer the effect mm concentr metformin given panc human pancreat cancer cell cultur conclus vascular effect mediat benefici_effect metformin breast_cancer a retrospect studi publish report patient diabet_treat metformin lower_risk cancer highlight possibl link metformin serin_threonin tumor suppressor mechan reduc risk see_tabl extens support protect_effect metformin cancer provid numer not studi for_instanc no associ shown use metformin lower_incid bladder cancer concern also express data observ studi analyz gov/about cancer/treatment/clin trials/intervention/ metformin hydrochlorid list number go clinic_trial involv metformin follow posit_breast cancer head_neck squamou_cell cancer endometri ovarian_cancer multipl_myeloma lymphocyt_leukemia thyroid cancer exampl_includ phase_ii studi design determin_whether metformin reduc obesityassoci breast_cancer risk due complet mid a phase_iii trial metformin versu_placebo recurr surviv earli_stage breast_cancer due complet earli a logic target wherebi metformin could mediat put antiprolif_effect cancer via inhibit mtor serin_threonin kinas ribosom either via activ ampk via ampk independ pathway it_also argu inhibit mitochondri complex import contributor cytotox effect metformin observ cancer cell support data show reduc inhibit tumor_growth cancer cell express metformin resist yeast complex argu higher concentr metformin necessari vitro cell cultur protocol abund growth_factor nutrient glucos reduc sensit inhibitori_effect metformin thu reflect import glucos warburg effect cancer cell growth well import glycem control diabet studi effect glucos concentr anti prolif effect metformin breast_cancer cell growth differ human cancer line in_vitro studi reveal tripl_neg breast_cancer cell tnbc particularli sensit pro prolif effect glucos tnbc cell sensit metformin lower level glucos also demonstr use cell cultur protocol higher level glucos reduc abil metformin inhibit cancer cell_prolifer an argument explain select action metformin cancer not differenti_express influx efflux transport tumor cell allow intracellular accumul metformin cancer cell result select toxic compar metformin uptak level inhibit activ cancer cell growth human breast_cancer cell_line bt defici oct bt cell_line overexpress organ cation transport cell also predomin transport human breast neoplasm in contrast although lncap prostat_cancer line prove particularli sensit metformin concentr rang within expect clinic correl high express mrna low express cell_line high concentr metformin requir see signific inhibit strong signific correl inhibit prolifer express not seen by lower plasma glucos level bodi weight metformin improv metabol profil patient therebi_reduc sever risk diseas associ diabet cardiovascular cancer also neurodegen diseas

psoriasis,Apremilast,"Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 2014 1 and the Drug Controller General of India in October 2017 for the management of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Apremilast has immunomodulatory activity which partially blocks the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and induces the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines that have a pathogenic role in psoriasis. Although the efficacy and safety of apremilast have been extensively documented in clinical trials, as well as in real-world studies on the management of both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] little is known about its real-world use, such as the correct positioning as monotherapy and combination therapy, titration practices, and variations in dosage. 8 To augment the existing evidence on the use of apremilast, a group of experts with over 15 years' experience in psoriasis came together to evaluate clinical and realworld scenarios and aspects of treatment for which the information in the literature was considered to be lacking. To assess the real-world experience of apremilast use in psoriasis, an expert panel was formed composed of five dermatologists with a minimum of 15 years' experience in the management of psoriasis and experience of apremilast prescription for at least 2 years. A total of 75 practicing dermatologists from India with a minimum of 10 years' experience in the management of psoriasis and 2 years of apremilast use were selected. A total of 28 questions were asked regarding different domains such as positioning of apremilast in psoriasis, its use in difficult-to-treat areas, special conditions and populations, safety, dose titration, and dose in maintenance therapy. In the landmark clinical trials on apremilast in plaque psoriasis, monotherapy was found to be safe and efficacious for the long term. Even real-world studies in India 9-11 supported the long-term use of apremilast monotherapy as an efficacious and safe treatment option for the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Besides monotherapy, apremilast in combination therapy could be used to reduce disease activity in recalcitrant plaque psoriasis. 12 Drug survival of apremilast in patients who were also on other systemic agents (84% survived the drug and 16% Our survey also revealed that a majority of the dermatologists preferred to use apremilast as a part of combination therapy in moderate to severe psoriasis. However, according to experts, apremilast monotherapy could also be used with good efficacy in patients with stable mild to moderate psoriasis with a body surface area (BSA) involvement <10%. This is supported by Del Alcazar et al, who concluded that apremilast may be an alternative for treating moderate psoriasis, with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of around 10. 17 The panel suggested that the combination of cyclosporine and apremilast could be a viable option in severe psoriasis by virtue of rapid relief with cyclosporine, followed by apremilast continued for a longer duration to maintain remission. The panel remarked that apremilast could be added as a maintenance or switchover drug in patients receiving methotrexate or cyclosporine with acceptable control of psoriasis. Currently, apremilast is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, but it has shown effectiveness in difficult-to-treat forms of psoriasis, such as scalp, face, palmoplantar, and nail psoriasis, and hence can be considered in these cases. 15, 23 The ESTEEM 1 AND ESTEEM 2 phase III doubleblinded efficacy and safety trials evaluated the efficacy of apremilast in nail and scalp psoriasis. 24 Various other studies have also shown the efficacy of apremilast for the treatment of palmoplantar psoriasis 25 and nail psoriasis. 26 The clinicians in our survey reported the use of apremilast for palmoplantar, scalp, and nail psoriasis, other than plaque psoriasis, as a second-line drug. 7% of the clinicians in our survey reported that up to 50% of their psoriasis patients have complete clearance of disease within 16 weeks of apremilast therapy. Paller et al, in a phase II study, 32 reported that apremilast 20 mg twice daily in 21 children in the age group 6-11 years with psoriasis had a similar pharmacokinetic profile to that of adults on apremilast 30 mg twice daily. 33, 34 Based on the available evidence and results of the survey, the experts opined that apremilast can be considered in pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis who are not responding to topical therapy. 42 The experts opined that apremilast may be of particular interest in patients with psoriasis along with obesity and metabolic syndrome, who may benefit from the side effect of weight loss. 60 In addition, apremilast, not being contraindicated in serious infections and providing other benefits, represents a promising therapeutic option in the management of psoriasis in HIV patients. A pooled analysis of landmark clinical trials in psoriasis did not report reactivation of TB with apremilast. 41 In the post-marketing report of 117,728 psoriasis patients who were exposed to apremilast, only three patients reported TB and none of the patients discontinued therapy with apremilast. 41 However, in a consensus study on the use of apremilast in psoriasis, published in 2020, 8 and a realworld study by Mayba and Gooderham, 7 it was recommended that laboratory monitoring should be carried out only in selected cases. 79 In addition, in a Spanish consensus study on the use of apremilast in psoriasis, it was recommended that a prolonged induction phase will serve as an effective strategy to mitigate gastrointestinal AEs. In various studies, apremilast has been evaluated as monotherapy or in combination therapy for long-term maintenance in patients with plaque psoriasis. 4, 6, 7 After considering these facts, the experts commented that apremilast should be preferred as long-term maintenance therapy in patients with plaque psoriasis because of its better safety profile, lack of organ toxicity, and reduced need for laboratory monitoring. Even though the approved dose of apremilast is 30 mg twice daily, a few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of apremilast 20 mg twice daily in patients with plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. [81] [82] [83] Ohtsuki et al reported similar results in patients with plaque psoriasis with apremilast 20 mg twice daily. The clinicians who participated in this study view apremilast as an attractive option for the individualized treatment of psoriasis. In the end, considering the chronicity of the disease and the comparative efficacy, safety, and use of this drug in comorbid conditions, apremilast has become one of the favorable options in the armamentarium of psoriasis management",1.0,35,0.0701505602240896,apremilast oral phosphodiesteras inhibitor approv_us food drug administr septemb drug control gener india octob manag moder_sever psoriasi_psoriat arthriti apremilast immunomodulatori activ partial_block express proinflammatori_cytokin induc express anti inflammatori_cytokin pathogen_role psoriasi although efficaci_safeti apremilast extens document clinic_trial well real_world studi manag psoriasi_psoriat arthriti littl known real_world use correct posit monotherapi combin therapi titrat practic variat dosag to augment exist evid use apremilast group expert year experi psoriasi came togeth evalu clinic realworld scenario aspect treatment inform literatur consid lack to_assess real_world experi apremilast use psoriasi expert panel form compos five dermatologist minimum year experi manag psoriasi experi apremilast prescript least year a total practic dermatologist india minimum year experi manag psoriasi year apremilast use select a total question ask regard differ domain posit apremilast psoriasi use difficult treat area special condit popul safeti dose titrat dose mainten therapi in landmark clinic_trial apremilast plaqu_psoriasi monotherapi found safe efficaci long_term even real_world studi india support long_term use apremilast monotherapi efficaci safe treatment_option manag moder_sever plaqu_psoriasi besid monotherapi apremilast combin therapi could use reduc diseas activ recalcitr plaqu_psoriasi drug surviv apremilast patient also system agent surviv drug our survey also reveal major dermatologist prefer use apremilast part combin therapi moder_sever psoriasi howev accord expert apremilast monotherapi could also use good efficaci patient stabl mild_moder psoriasi bodi surfac area bsa involv thi support del alcazar et_al conclud apremilast may altern treat moder psoriasi psoriasi area sever index pasi score around the panel suggest combin cyclosporin apremilast could viabl option sever psoriasi virtu rapid relief cyclosporin follow apremilast continu longer durat maintain remiss the panel remark apremilast could ad mainten switchov drug patient receiv methotrex cyclosporin accept control psoriasi current apremilast approv treatment moder_sever psoriasi shown effect difficult treat form psoriasi scalp face palmoplantar nail psoriasi henc consid case the esteem and esteem phase_iii doubleblind efficaci_safeti trial evalu_efficaci apremilast nail scalp psoriasi variou studi also shown_efficaci apremilast treatment palmoplantar psoriasi nail psoriasi the clinician survey report use apremilast palmoplantar scalp nail psoriasi plaqu_psoriasi second_line drug clinician survey report psoriasi patient complet clearanc diseas within_week apremilast therapi paller et_al phase_ii studi report apremilast mg_twice daili children age group year psoriasi similar pharmacokinet_profil adult apremilast mg_twice daili base avail evid result survey expert opin apremilast consid pediatr_patient plaqu_psoriasi not respond topic therapi the expert opin apremilast may particular interest patient psoriasi along obes_metabol syndrom may benefit side_effect weight_loss in_addit apremilast not_contraind seriou infect provid_benefit repres promis therapeut option manag psoriasi hiv patient a pool_analysi landmark clinic_trial psoriasi not report reactiv tb apremilast in post_market report psoriasi patient expos apremilast three patient report tb none patient discontinu therapi apremilast howev consensu studi use apremilast psoriasi publish realworld studi mayba gooderham recommend laboratori monitor carri select case in_addit spanish consensu studi use apremilast psoriasi recommend prolong induct phase serv effect strategi mitig gastrointestin ae in variou studi apremilast evalu monotherapi combin therapi long_term mainten patient plaqu_psoriasi after consid fact expert comment apremilast prefer long_term mainten therapi patient plaqu_psoriasi better safeti_profil lack organ toxic reduc need laboratori monitor even_though approv dose apremilast mg_twice daili studi evalu_efficaci safeti apremilast mg_twice daili patient plaqu_psoriasi psoriat_arthriti ohtsuki et_al report similar result patient plaqu_psoriasi apremilast mg_twice daili the clinician particip studi view apremilast attract option individu treatment psoriasi in end consid chronic diseas compar efficaci_safeti use drug comorbid condit apremilast becom one favor option armamentarium psoriasi manag

influenza,Pomegranate,"Pomegranate juice and concentrated liquid pomegranate extract showed antiviral activity against the influenza viruses, PR8 (H1N1), and X31 (H3N2) [13]. The pomegranate juice can neutralize the infectivity and effective against the different types of enveloped viruses like influenza A (H3N2), H5N1, and a reassortant X31 strain [14]. The pomegranate juice with fulvic acid showed an effective antiviral property by inactivating different strains of influenza viruses especially H5N1 after treated for 5 min at 37 Â°C. The n-butanol and ethyl acetate fractions attained from the pomegranate fruit peel extract effectively inhibited influenza A PR8 replication in the MDCK cell line with the IC 50 of 6.

osteosarcoma,Methotrexate,"In most osteosarcoma treatments, methotrexate is used at a much higher dose than other drugs, so L2 norm would put too much weight on methotrexate dose and neglect other drugs' doses. The most common chemotherapy regimen for osteosarcoma in children and young adults is the MAP regimen, which is a combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and high-dose methotrexate [39]. A combination of doxorubicin and cisplatin (AP) is a very common treatment of osteosarcoma tumors in older adults, as they are less likely to be able to tolerate high-dose methotrexate. High-dose methotrexate (MTX) has also been used as a single agent to treat osteosarcoma, with four courses of 8 to 12 mg/m 2 given weekly before surgery [131]",1.0,2,0.0476428571428571,in osteosarcoma treatment methotrex use much_higher dose drug norm would put much weight methotrex dose neglect drug dose the_common chemotherapi regimen osteosarcoma children young adult map regimen combin doxorubicin cisplatin high dose methotrex a combin doxorubicin cisplatin ap common treatment osteosarcoma tumor older_adult less like abl toler high dose methotrex high dose methotrex_mtx also use singl agent treat osteosarcoma four cours mg/m given weekli surgeri
COVID-19,Tocilizumab,"The most studied interleukin is perhaps IL-6, given that tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor, can be used as therapy for COVID-19 patients who present signs of hyperinflammation. Tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab are Food and Drug Administration-(FDA-) approved IL-6 inhibitors evaluated for the management of patients with COVID-19 who have systemic inflammation. Tocilizumab in combination with dexamethasone are indicated in certain hospitalized patients who are exhibiting rapid respiratory decompensation due to COVID-19 [101]. Further findings from REMAP-CAP and the RECOV-ERY study justify the use of tocilizumab in certain hospitalized patients with rapid respiratory decompensation due to COVID-19 [102]",1.0,15,0.0811011904761904,the studi interleukin perhap il given tocilizumab monoclon_antibodi direct il receptor use therapi covid patient present sign hyperinflamm tocilizumab sarilumab siltuximab food drug administr_fda approv il inhibitor evalu manag patient covid system inflamm tocilizumab combin dexamethason indic certain hospit patient exhibit rapid respiratori decompens due covid further find remap cap recov eri studi justifi use tocilizumab certain hospit patient rapid respiratori decompens due covid
